                <strong>Courtyard</strong>, <strong>Parkside</strong>, <strong>Park Place</strong>, and <strong>Park View</strong> focus their business on locations where the average household earns middle to upper-middle class wages (between 150k-160k). In contrast, <strong>Riverview</strong> appears to operate mostly in locations where, on average, the household income is closer to 100k or less (with a few notable outliers). Of the communities served by all these companies, the ones on the west coast and Texas tend to have higher average incomes.
