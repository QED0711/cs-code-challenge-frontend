                There is little spread across the six companies in this category. On average, the median age of the citizens in these locations is around 35 years old. However, there are a handful of locations where the median age is much higher than this. Older communities are served by <strong>Hillcrest</strong> in Florida and Arizona, by <strong>Courtyard</strong> in Nevada, and by <strong>Riverview</strong> in Washington, Oklahoma, and Nebraska.
