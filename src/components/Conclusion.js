                    If you want that big city feel, you might look into locations in California or Texas, with several offerings from all six companies on our list. If you're looking for something more rural, there are again several offerings from different companies, but <strong>Riverview</strong> may have the most experience dealing with these types of communities.

                    If you're hoping to find a retirement community, <strong>Hillcrest</strong> serves a number of more elderly communities in the south and south-west US. If you're looking for a younger demographic, see what <strong>Parkside</strong> has available in several states across the country.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're raising kids, or taking care of an elderly family member, <strong>Courtyard</strong> has a number of offerings in locations that might have the amenities and services right for you.

                    And if you're employed or looking for work, and are interested in housing opportunities that won't break the bank, <strong>Couryard</strong>, <strong>Park Place</strong>, <strong>Park View</strong>, and <strong>Parkside</strong> generally serve areas that may be a good fit for your needs. But you may want to avoid west coast locations and Texas where your wages would need to be higher to afford housing, or Alaska, where there is high unemployment.
